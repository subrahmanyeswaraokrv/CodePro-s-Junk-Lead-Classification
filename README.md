Features
Lead Classification: Classifies sales leads as either "Junk" or "Valid."
Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts to clean and prepare data, handle missing values, and scale/normalize features.
Multiple Model Options: Choose from different machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Predict New Leads: Predict the classification of new leads based on trained models.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need pip to install dependencies.

Step-by-Step Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/subrahmanyeswaraokrv/CodePro-s-Junk-Lead-Classification.git
cd CodePro-s-Junk-Lead-Classification
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing script (data_preprocessing.py) cleans the input data, handles missing values, and processes categorical features for model input. You can run the preprocessing with:

bash
Copy
python data_preprocessing.py
Model Training
After preprocessing the data, you can train the machine learning model using the train_model.py script. You can specify the model type you wish to use, such as Random Forest or XGBoost.

Example of training a model:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py --model xgboost
This script will save the trained model to a file, which can be used for making predictions.

Predict New Leads
To classify new leads, use the predict.py script. Provide a CSV file containing new leads for prediction.

Example:

bash
Copy
python predict.py --lead_data new_lead.csv
This will output whether the leads are classified as "Junk" or "Valid."

Model Evaluation
The evaluate_model.py script helps evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Example:

bash
Copy
python evaluate_model.py
This will display the evaluation metrics for the trained model.
